## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: ComponentsKit approved as the only third-party SPM dependency — all other UI is Apple-native SwiftUI
- [Init]: Per-tab NavigationStack isolation is non-negotiable — must be established in Phase 1 before any feature screens are built (irreversible pitfall if deferred)
- [Init]: All @Observable classes must be @MainActor — synchronous mock data returns avoid actor isolation complexity entirely
- [Init]: Subscriber journey (Phases 3-7) takes priority over creator tools (Phase 8) — demo critical path is subscriber-side

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Confetti PhaseAnimator + Canvas implementation is MEDIUM confidence — build standalone prototype early in Phase 4 before integrating into PaymentSuccessView
- [Phase 6]: iOS 26 Liquid Glass tab bar safe-area inset behavior with scroll views needs simulator verification in Phase 1 before feed views are built

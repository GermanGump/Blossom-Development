# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Blossom ambassadors and creators can monetize their investing expertise through tiered paid communities, while subscribers get access to premium content and engagement they can't get from the free social feed.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Community Detail Screen (ready to begin)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 9 COMPLETE — advancing to Phase 3 (Community Detail Screen)
Plan: 3 of 3 complete in Phase 2 (all verified)
Status: Phase 2 complete — ready for Phase 3
Last activity: 2026-03-11 — Phase 2 fully complete — visual verification approved (Inter font, dark mode, ambassador photos confirmed)

Progress: [██▒░░░░░░░] 22%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: ComponentsKit approved as the only third-party SPM dependency — all other UI is Apple-native SwiftUI
- [Init]: Per-tab NavigationStack isolation is non-negotiable — must be established in Phase 1 before any feature screens are built (irreversible pitfall if deferred)
- [Init]: All @Observable classes must be @MainActor — synchronous mock data returns avoid actor isolation complexity entirely
- [Init]: Subscriber journey (Phases 3-7) takes priority over creator tools (Phase 8) — demo critical path is subscriber-side
- [Phase 01]: NavigationStack placed inside each TabView tab (not wrapping it) — enforces per-tab back-stack isolation from day one
- [Phase 01]: connectedScenes API used for safe area inset reading — replaces deprecated UIApplication.shared.windows, iOS 26 compliant
- [Phase 01]: HubsView does NOT contain its own NavigationStack — ContentView wraps it; pattern must be maintained for all future tab content views
- [Phase 02-01]: Inter font v4.0 sourced from rsms/inter GitHub release — PostScript names Inter-Regular, Inter-Medium, Inter-SemiBold confirmed via binary inspection
- [Phase 02-01]: BlossomSecondaryText dark value #8B92A8 — mid-tone blue-gray readable on #2A2E38 dark card surface
- [Phase 02-01]: Color(hex:) extension retained in BlossomTheme.swift for utility but no brand color properties use it
- [Phase 02-01]: preferredColorScheme(.light) removed from BlossomHubsApp to enable real device dark mode testing
- [Phase 02]: SF Symbol icon sizing uses .font(.system(size:)) intentionally — BlossomFont tokens apply to text only, not icon point sizes
- [Phase 02]: AvatarView showVerifiedBadge (creator identity) and showBadge (ambassador bolt) are separate params serving different semantic purposes
- [Phase 02-03]: PostType enum (.text, .tradeHighlight, .youtubeLink) gives content feed rendering logic a discriminator for Phase 6
- [Phase 02-03]: DEBUG assertion placed in .task {} modifier on ContentView (not init()) because @State store isn't accessible from init
- [Phase 02-03]: CommunityStore uses private extension per ambassador — one extension per ambassador, easy to maintain individually

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Confetti PhaseAnimator + Canvas implementation is MEDIUM confidence — build standalone prototype early in Phase 4 before integrating into PaymentSuccessView
- [Phase 6]: iOS 26 Liquid Glass tab bar safe-area inset behavior with scroll views needs simulator verification in Phase 1 before feed views are built
